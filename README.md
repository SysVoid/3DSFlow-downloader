# 3DSFlow-downloader
This is for the "3DSFlow" project that started with [this GBAtemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/gridlauncher-3dsflow-project-box-cover-banners.405303/). A downloader for the Nintendo 3DS (WIP), and the site source code, are both contained within this repository.

You can find older revisions of the site as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ihaveamac/b2229c8feb513476e745).

The downloader uses lpp-3ds r4 by Rinnegatamante. Please see [its repo](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds) for more details, including license. Releases use the "normal" build with error handling.
